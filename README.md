# InputOutput project
I chose to control a servo motor with a photoresistor for this project

please find the Arduiono code in the files 
there are photos of the circuit and the schematic in the issues

There is a link to the video of the circuit working. I don't know why I couldn't downsize the gif to 10K this week 

The value 0-120 that has been used in my code in the value I could read in my SerialPlotter from my sensor
A 10K resitor has been used for the sensor (Photoresistor)
